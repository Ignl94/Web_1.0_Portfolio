    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>
      Ignl was born in the heart of a dying star named XJ347P/Alpha<sup>3</sup>,
      also known as Lady Gaga. At one point in time and space long before planet
      Earth was formed Lady Gaga had a cold. She asked her boyfriend Nebulon-6
      to go to the Milky Way and get her some ingredients for tea. But he was to
      busy playing Call Of Duty Galactic Warfare and he never went. She got
      tired of waiting for him so she decided to go herself. On her way there
      she got caught in a really bad meteor shower. The meteor shower was so bad
      she had to pull over because her GPS wasn't working. Lady Gaga couldn't
      tell which way to go and just when she thought all hope was lost she saw
      God passing by riding a space unicorn named Cozmo. She got super excited
      and started calling his name for help. He had his headphones on but he
      could still hear her cuz he's God and it's what he does, so he and Cozmo
      headed her way. He was like <q>Whassup Alpha<sup>3</sup>!</q>, and she was
      like
      <q
        >Nuthin, just got this stupid cold and I got lost on my way to the milky
        way</q
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      God being the cool bro that he was was like
      <q>I totally got something for that</q>. He gave her some 'Chemical X' and
      assured her it was completely safe cuz he got it from his boy Tiger. He
      also gave her a Moral Compass so that she could find her way whenever she
      was lost, then he screamed "Anarchy" and rode off into another dimension.
      Lady Gaga eager to get rid of her cold took the 'Chemical X'. When she did
      her cold disappeared and the fires of Ignl was born in its place inside of
      her. Ignl was such a pimp that he blew her up from the inside. But it was
      all good because the 'Chemical X' made her a savage and she was reborn as
      Mother Nature. Mother Nature, formerly known as Lady Gaga Aka
      XJ347P/Alpha<sup>3</sup> left her boyfriend Nebulon-6, took her new Moral
      Compass and became a business woman creating life on empty planets. And
      Ignl spends his days possessing the bodies of her creations making them
      total pimps. Ignl has been Buddha, Jesus, One Punch Man, Bruce Lee, Pootie
      Tang, Austin Powers and countless other great historical figures of planet
      Earth. He was also the giant flying jellyfish king of planet Mars but
      things didn't go so well there.
